Commons Clause
Software: ResumeOwn

The MIT License (Exhibit A) shall apply, and this clause is intended as a supplement to that license.

Except when, prior to download, install, or modify the Software, you (Client) have entered into a written agreement with the original software author (Author) or an authorized distributor which agreed to:

Clause 1: "This software is for non-commercial use only."

You confirm to the Author that any source code you distribute or use will be distributed under the same terms of the MIT License.

This means that you shall not, and shall not permit any third party to, (i) sell, lease, license, or otherwise exploit the Software or any modifications or derivative works thereof, except through a free market substantially similar to (or more permissive than) the open source MIT License.

By using, distributing, or otherwise making available the Software, you (Client) agree to the terms of this Commons Clause in addition to the MIT License, and to comply with the restrictions set forth above.

This clause does not affect any personal use exemptions under the MIT License.

For the avoidance of doubt, the following activities are considered "Commercial Use":

• Incorporating the Software or any modification thereof into a commercial product.
• Selling, renting, offering for sale, or distributing the Software as part of a commercial product.
• Offering the Software as a service, or by otherwise hosting or enabling access to the Software.
• Using the Software in the operation of a business, including but not limited to using the Software in any type of hosting, processing, storage, or other business-related activities.

To the extent that this clause restricts commercial use in ways that would be contrary to applicable law, this clause shall be deemed void and of no force or effect, and the MIT License shall remain in full force and effect, except as otherwise agreed by the Author in writing.

This clause is voidable by the Author at any time, and the Author shall inform you in writing in the event of such voidance.

By using the Software, you agree to comply with the terms set forth in this license.
